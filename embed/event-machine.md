# Embedding Sinatra within EventMachine

EventMachine is a very useful tool and sometimes you need to add a web-interface
on top of it. Yes, EM does support this out of the box, but it can be ugly and
hard to work with. Why not use something that everyone already knows and loves
like Sinatra?

Below is a (working) code-sample for running a simple HelloWorld Sinatra app
within EventMachine. I've also provided a simple example of deferring tasks
within your Sinatra call.

```ruby
require 'eventmachine'
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'thin'


# This example shows you how to embed Sinatra into your EventMachine
# application. This is very useful if you're application needs some
# sort of API interface and you don't want to use EM's provided
# web-server.

def run(opts)

  # Start he reactor
  EM.run do

    # define some defaults for our app
    server  = opts[:server] || 'thin'
    host    = opts[:host]   || '0.0.0.0'
    port    = opts[:port]   || '8181'
    web_app = opts[:app]

    # create a base-mapping that our application will set at. If I
    # have the following routes:
    #
    #   get '/hello' do
    #     'hello!'
    #   end
    #
    #   get '/goodbye' do
    #     'see ya later!'
    #   end
    #
    # Then I will get the following:
    #
    #   mapping: '/'
    #   routes:
    #     /hello
    #     /goodbye
    #
    #   mapping: '/api'
    #   routes:
    #     /api/hello
    #     /api/goodbye
    dispatch = Rack::Builder.app do
      map '/' do
        run web_app
      end
    end

    # NOTE that we have to use an EM-compatible web-server. There
    # might be more, but these are some that are currently available.
    unless ['thin', 'hatetepe', 'goliath'].include? server
      raise "Need an EM webserver, but #{server} isn't"
    end

    # Start the web server. Note that you are free to run other tasks
    # within your EM instance.
    Rack::Server.start({
      app:    dispatch,
      server: server,
      Host:   host,
      Port:   port
    })
  end
end

# Our simple hello-world app
class HelloApp < Sinatra::Base
  # threaded - False: Will take requests on the reactor thread
  #            True:  Will queue request for background thread
  configure do
    set :threaded, false
  end

  # Request runs on the reactor thread (with threaded set to false)
  get '/hello' do
    'Hello World'
  end

  # Request runs on the reactor thread (with threaded set to false)
  # and returns immediately. The deferred task does not delay the
  # response from the web-service.
  get '/delayed-hello' do
    EM.defer do
      sleep 5
    end
    'I\'m doing work in the background, but I am still free to take requests'
  end
end

# start the application
run app: HelloApp.new
```

You can run this simply with the command:

```bash
ruby em-sinatra-test.rb   # em-sinatra-test.rb is the filename of the above-code
```

You should also be able to test that it is working correctly with the
following `ab` command:

```bash
ab -c 10 -n 100 http://localhost:8181/delayed-hello
```

If this finishes in "zero point something" seconds, then you have successfully
setup Sinatra to run within EM and you are taking requests on the event-loop
and deferring tasks to the background. If it takes any longer than that, then
you are most likely taking requests in the background which means when the EM
queue fills up, you can't process your sinatra requests (not a good thing!).
Make sure that you have threaded set to false and then try again.
