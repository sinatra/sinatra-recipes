Using Capybara
--------------

### Steak

```ruby
# spec/acceptance/acceptance_helper.rb

ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test'

require 'rubygems'
require 'steak'
require 'rack/test'
require 'capybara/dsl'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Capybara
end

require File.expand_path '../../../my-app.rb', __FILE__

Capybara.app = Sinatra::Application
```

**My Page Acceptance Spec**

```ruby
require File.expand_path '../acceptance_helper.rb', __FILE__

feature "My Page" do

  scenario "greets the visitor" do
    visit "/"
    page.should have_content "Welcome to my page!"
  end

end
```

**The Future of Steak**

Capybara's acceptance testing DSL was [recently added](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/commit/f4897f890d8dd33215fef238902988e8823a6539). They just basically consumed Steak, since it was always "a gist that happened to be distributed as a Ruby gem." It won't be included until the next release of Capybara, but after that, Steak won't be needed, unless you're using an older version of Capybara for some reason.
