# How can I internationalize my application? {#i18n}

We will rely on the `i18n` gem to handle internationalisation
of strings and objects, and to manage fallbacks on available locales

```ruby
require 'i18n'
require 'i18n/backend/fallbacks'
```

The following configuration is necessary on I18n so that:

  * it can fallback on other locales if the requested one is not
    available (ie: translation does not exist).
  * all the translations are read from YAML files located in the
    `locales` directory

```ruby
configure do
  I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)
  I18n.load_path = Dir[File.join(settings.root, 'locales', '*.yml')]
  I18n.backend.load_translations
end
```

Now we need to choose the locale that the user wants. There are several
solutions (and some can even be mixed together): browser preference,
specific URL, dedicated subdomain, cookies/session management.
Only the first three will be shown below:

### Browser preference (requires `rack-contrib`)

```ruby
use Rack::Locale
```

### Specific URL

```ruby
before '/:locale/*' do
  I18n.locale       =       params[:locale]
  request.path_info = '/' + params[:splat ][0]
end
```

### Dedicated subdomain

```ruby
before do
  if (locale = request.host.split('.')[0]) != 'www'
    I18n.locale = locale
  end
end
```

We have all the necessary information to deliver to the user
texts/pages in their native language. And for that we will need to
select strings and templates according to the desired locale.

Selection of localized strings/objects is easy as it only requires
use of standard methods from `I18n`

```ruby
I18n.t(:token)
I18n.l(Time.now)
```

For rendering the templates matching the desired locale, we need to
extend the `find_template` method.  It needs to select the first
template matching the user locale (or at least one acceptable
fallback). To help in the selection process templates stored 
in the `views` directory are suffixed by the name of the locale.

```ruby
helpers do
  def find_template(views, name, engine, &block)
    I18n.fallbacks[I18n.locale].each { |locale|
      super(views, "#{name}.#{locale}", engine, &block) }
    super(views, name, engine, &block)
  end
end
```
