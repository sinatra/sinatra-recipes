Using Rack::Parser to encapsulate parsing logic in web service applications
===========================

Sinatra is often used for web service applications. One common need these 
applications have is to parse incoming messages, typically JSON or XML.

Often this is a two step process -- first parsing the message string into 
predictable data structures, then loading that into models. So a typical route 
might look like

```ruby
post '/messages'
  message = Message.from_hash( ::MultiJson.decode(request.body) )
  message.save
  halt 202, {'Location' => "/messages/#{message.id}"}, ''
end
```

And your Message model would have an appropriate `#from_hash` method that
grabs what it needs from the parsed message and throws it into a new instance.

If your application has several different endpoints, all using the same 
content-type, you could save some repetition by moving it to a helper:

```ruby
helpers do
  def parsed_body
    ::MultiJson.decode(request.body)
  end
end

post '/orders'
  order = Order.from_hash( parsed_body )
  order.process
  # ....
end
```

This works fine for simple scenarios. But if you have multiple content-types, 
need to validate the message format, or do other pre-processing on it, moving
the parsing logic out of your application itself starts to become attractive.

One option is to move it into a module that your app extends.

But another option is to do the parsing in a middleware. That way, your app is
not responsible for doing the basic parsing at all -- it's done and exposed to
your app by the time the request arrives.

The idea is *to mimic what Rack does to process form data*, which is to populate
the `env[rack.request.form_hash]` with a hash, and then expose that through the
`params` hash. But instead of parsing url parameters or multipart form data, it 
will parse the XML or JSON body.

**`Rack::Parser`** is a Rack middleware that does just that, and lets you 
configure custom parsing routines for any given content-type. 

So using Rack::Parser, the example above would be changed to

```ruby
# in config.ru
use Rack::Parser, :content_types => {
  'application/json'  => Proc.new { |body| ::MultiJson.decode body }
}

# in application
post '/orders'
  order = Order.from_hash( params['order'] )
  order.process
  # ....
end
```

This is quite convenient if your app accepts either form data or JSON for a 
given endpoint -- since the code is then identical whether a user submits a 
form directly or some web-service client submits a JSON request.

## Custom parsing

Note that the content-type handlers are just procs (or anything that responds to
`#call`) that take a single parameter -- the request body. 

This makes it quite easy to set up custom parsing, validation, or other pre-
processing. 

Rack::Parser also has recently added support for error handling, so that errors
in parsing can be mapped into a suitable http response, and logged. This is 
quite useful for handling validation errors.

For instance, say you have set up vendor-specific json message formats, which
you want to validate using a `validate_input` class method on your models.

```ruby
class MyJsonParser

  def initialize(validator_class)
    @klass = validator_class
  end

  def call(body)
    json = ::MultiJson.decode(body)
    if @klass.respond_to?(:validate_input)
      @klass.validate_input(json)
    end
    json
  end

end

use Rack::Parser, :content_types => {
  'application/vnd-my-message+json' => MyJsonParser.new(Message),
  'application/vnd-my-order+json'   => MyJsonParser.new(Order)
}
```


Then any parsing error raised in `MulitJson.decode` or validation error in 
`validate_input` will result in a 400 (bad request) response *in the same 
content-type as the request* -- like

```ruby
{"errors": "Validation error in input - cannot set 'private_info'"}
```

This is the default; you can also completely customize how errors are converted
into responses, per content-type.
