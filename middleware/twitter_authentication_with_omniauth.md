## Twitter authentication with OmniAuth

[OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) provides several strategies
(released as gems) that provides authentication for a lot of systems, such as
Facebook, Google, GitHub, and
[many more](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies).

Each strategy is a Rack middleware, so it's very easy to integrate with
Sinatra. This recipe will show you how to add user authentication to your
Sinatra application using Twitter as your authentication provider.

First, you have to create a new application at
[Twitter Developers](https://dev.twitter.com/). It's very important to set
the `Callback url` to `http://example.com/auth/twitter/callback`. This url is
where twitter will redirect the client when the user is successfully
authenticated. Once you created your application, you have to remember it's
`Consumer key` and `Consumer secret`. You will need them when you configure
Omniauth, like this:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'omniauth-twitter'

configure do
  enable :sessions

  use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :twitter, ENV['CONSUMER_KEY'], ENV['CONSUMER_SECRET']
  end
end
```

Note that we used the CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET environment variables.
This is because it's bad to store this information on your code, so each time
you run your app do it like this:

```bash
$ CONSUMER_KEY=<your consumer key> CONSUMER_SECRET=<your consumer secret> ruby app.rb
```

If you are using rackup, the same rule applies.

Then, you have to secure your application by redirecting non-authenticated
users to twitter, so they can sign in:

```ruby
helpers do
  # define a current_user method, so we can be sure if an user is authenticated
  def current_user
    !session[:uid].nil?
  end
end

before do
  # we do not want to redirect to twitter when the path info starts
  # with /auth/
  pass if request.path_info =~ /^\/auth\//

  # /auth/twitter is captured by omniauth:
  # when the path info matches /auth/twitter, omniauth will redirect to twitter
  redirect to('/auth/twitter') unless current_user
end
```

Lastly, you have create a new user session when the authentication was
successful:

```ruby
get '/auth/twitter/callback' do
  # probably you will need to create a user in the database too...
  session[:uid] = env['omniauth.auth']['uid']
  # this is the main endpoint to your application
  redirect to('/')
end

get '/auth/failure' do
  # omniauth redirects to /auth/failure when it encounters a problem
  # so you can implement this as you please
end

get '/' do
  'Hello omniauth-twitter!'
end
```

Needless to say that this approach is useful for other omniauth strategies.
